The source-code contains four files:

- extractHand.cpp -> given an input image, it extracts the handwriting and saves it as an output image.
- extractTemplate.cpp -> given an input image, it extracts the template and save it as an output image.
- extractFeats.cpp -> given an input image, the handwriting image and the class identifier, it extracts the features and save them in the RMS.txt file.
- run.sh -> script that contains a toy example of the execution code

Steps to follow:
1. run "./compile.sh" to compile all .cpp files
2. run "run.sh"
