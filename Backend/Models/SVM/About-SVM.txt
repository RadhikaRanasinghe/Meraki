Support-vector machines work by finding data points of different classes and drawing boundaries between them. The selected data points are
called the support-vectors and the boundaries are called hyperplanes.

------------SVM - Parameter Tuning--------------

clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', gamma='auto', C=2)

kernel trick 
- A kernel is just a function which takes two data points as inputs and returns a similarity score. This similarity can 
be interpreted as a metric of closeness. The nearer the data points are, the higher the similarity.

Types of kernel - linear(boundries are linear), RBF(boundaries are bell-curve shaped), Polynomial(non-linear type)



C: The Penalty Parameter
-It tells the algorithm how much you care about misclassified points.

-A high value for C tells the algorithm that you care more about classifying all of the training points correctly than leaving wiggle room for future data.
ex:- if increase the C parameter, youâ€™re betting that the training data contains the most extreme possible observations.



Gamma in SVM
The gamma parameter makes most intuitive sense when we think about the RBF (or Gaussian) kernel. For the other kernels usually the default value is 'auto'.
